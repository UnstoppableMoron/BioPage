        <h1>My name is Owen Baker.</h1>
        <h2>General information</h2>
        <p>I live in Massena, New York, at 24 Walnut Avenue. I was born on February 20th, 2008, and lived in Cicero, New York for several years afterward. In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and playing video games.
        Some of my favorite video games are Hollow Knight, A Hat in Time, and Persona 5.</p>
        <p>I like to listen to music from the three aforementioned games, as well as from others. I also enjoy listening to a few individual artists, such as Teminite and DM Dokuro.</p>
        <p>I have a couple of cats, as well as two dogs. I also took care of one of my friend's cats for a little over a month earlier this year. I kid you not, his name is Coffee Table. We just call him Coffee though.</p>
        <p>My favorite book series is easily Wings of Fire by Tui T. Sutherland, with my favorite book in the series being Legends: Darkstalker. Darkstalker is coincidentally my favorite character in the entire series.</p>
        
        
        <h2>My pets</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, I have two cats named Marshmallow and Peaches, but I also have two dogs, named Boki and Delilah.</p>




        <p>For about the first half of my life, I lived with both of my parents. They got divorced in 2017, and I spent the next several years swapping between houses every week. That lasted until early September of last year, when I stopped living with my dad entirely, because he isn't a very good person, to put it lightly.</p>
